2. What is the use of bind() function in socket programming  ? 

Answer:

1.On systems with multiple network interfaces, bind() allows you to specify which interface the server socket should listen on. This ensures that incoming connections are received through the desired network interface.

2.By specifying the IP address in the bind() call, you can restrict the server to listen for incoming connections only on that particular IP address. 

3.The bind() function also associates a specific port number with the server socket. This allows clients to connect to the server using that port number.
