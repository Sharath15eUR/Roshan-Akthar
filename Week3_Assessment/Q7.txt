7. What is the difference between exec and fork ?


1.fork starts a new process which is a copy of the one that calls it, while exec replaces the current process image with another (different) one.
2.Both parent and child processes are executed simultaneously in case of fork() while Control never returns to the original program unless there is an exec() error.
