8. What is the difference between process and threads. 


1.A process is independent and does not contained within another process, whereas all threads are logically contained within a process.
2.Processes are heavily weighted, whereas threads are light-weighted.
3.A process can exist individually as it contains its own memory and other resources, whereas a thread cannot have its individual existence.
4.A proper synchronization between processes is not required. In contrast, threads need to be synchronized in order to avoid unexpected  scenarios.
5.Processes can communicate with each other using inter-process communication only; in contrast, threads can directly communicate with each other as they share the same address space.
